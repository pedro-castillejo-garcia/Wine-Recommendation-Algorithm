Description: This is a recommendation system which helps buyers to find wine bottles from a data set to save their time and money. The python algorithms build co-occurrence matrix and based on different parameters such as wine description, country and province of origin, variety, reviews (in a scale from 0-100 points) and price segment, the most similar products are returned from the database as recommendation.
